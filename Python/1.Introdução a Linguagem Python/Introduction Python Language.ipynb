    "    It comes with a large standard library that supports many common\n",
    "    programming, such as connecting to web servers, searching text with\n",
    "    regular expressions, read and modify files.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    it has numerous libraries that extend its acting power. It is an\n",

    "    Allows multiple attriburion. We can assing values to more than one variable\n",
    "    in a single instruction. For example, a,b = 2,3.\n",
    "    \n",
    "One of the grat features of the language is its syntax. One of the main\n",
    "Guido's idea is that code is read much more often than it is\n",
    "written (PEP 9 - Style Guide for Python Code). This aspect is so important that a \n",
    "code that follows the rules of the python language is called \"pythonic code\". These\n",
    "rules are defined by PEP 8 (Python Enhancement Proposal) and concern\n",
    "formatting, identation, parameters in functions and anything else that might be\n",
    "related to code syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has proven to be a very powerful language and is being widely\n",
    "adopted by professionals in the data area.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python 3 interpreter uses unicode by defalt, which makes it possible to use\n",
    "variable names with accents and even other special characters, but it is not a \n",
    "good practice. Such flexibility shows why the language has been adopted by \n",

    "In the Python interpreter installation process, you need to check the Add option\n",

    "you will need to configure it manually later.\n",

    "When completing the interpreter installation, if you checked the option \"Add Python 3.X\n",
